# Welcome!

Welcome to the Kharchenko lab! These are a few potentially useful tips and resources to help you get started. 

## Harvard Orchestra

The [`Orchestra`](https://rc.hms.harvard.edu/#orchestra) cluster is a shared high-performance computing environment serving a large research community with diverse research requirements and workflows. The cluster comprises more than 400 Linux compute nodes and 4500 cores, provides access to 10TB of disk space on a high-performance Isilon storage cluster for ongoing computational tasks, and allows for multiple job submissions via Platform Computingâ€™s LSF resource management system, thereby allowing for powerful computations to be completed quickly. Tens of thousands of jobs run on the cluster every day! We work on `Orchestra` frequently so you will need to get an Orchestra account:
